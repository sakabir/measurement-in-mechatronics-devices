The purpose of the measurement:
•	In this project, the ultrasonic sensor reads and writes the distance to an object in the serial monitor.
•	Implementing the switch that monitors the sensing range of the ultrasound sensor.
•	presenting the sensing distance of the sensor with a led

Components used in the measurement:
•	Ultrasonic Distance Sensor that has four pins: VCC (Power), Trig (Trigger), Echo (Receive), and GND (Ground).
•	Breadboard
•	Jumper wires
•	LED
•	Load resistance
•	Arduino UNO

Method of the measurement:
•	First, we connected the sensor to ground GND before plugging in the power supply 5V in arduino.
•	Then we connected the sensor Echo and Trigger feet to the pins: (Echo=>10; Trig=>9).
•	Thirdly, we connected the status LED to the output (12). 
•	After that the led through the load resistance were connected.
•	For the next step,  we wrote the code.
•	The code was uploaded to the Arduino board. Then, we opened the Serial Monitor and plotter for output.
•	During the measurement, the transmitter emits ultrasound pulses reflected by the transmitter sensing from the elements in the detection range.
•	A short 10 µs pulse sent to input to start measuring, then the module sent an 8-cycle ultrasound signal at 40 kHz and analyzed its echo.
Results:
•	The signal coming from the sensor will first be converted to distance data: 
•	Detection distance = (Perceived signal * speed of sound)/2
•	We collected some distance data, The distance to the nearest object is printed in the Serial Monitor window. for example: 3,5,6,7,11 as shown in the fig below.
•	According to the length of each distance it makes a peak on the chart as shown below.
